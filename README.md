## Description

Demo iOS App for using the XYO Protocol 2.0 from Swift. Designed to work in both Mac OS and iOS.

## Instructions

### Add Package

```swift
dependencies: [
.package(url: "https://github.com/XYOracleNetwork/app-ios-witness-demo-swiftui.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "3.0.0")),
],
```

### Configure API

Setup which network you'd like to write to by configuring the Domain & Archivist Module Name

```swift
let apiDomain = "https://beta.api.archivist.xyo.network"
let archive = "Archivist"
```

### Configure Witnesses

Configure your desired witnesses (Basic, System Info, Location, etc.)

```swift
let basicWitness = BasicWitness {
    Payload("network.xyo.basic")
}
let systemInfoWitness = SystemInfoWitness(allowPathMonitor: true)
let locationWitness = LocationWitness()
```

### Configure Panel

Use the Witnesses & Archivist config to create a Panel

```swift
let panel = XyoPanel(
    account: self.panelAccount,
    witnesses: [
        basicWitness,
        systemInfoWitness,
        locationWitness
    ],
    apiDomain: apiDomain,
    archive: archive
)
```

### Generate BoundWitness report

Call `.report()` to return the witnessed Payloads

```swift
let payloads =  await panel.report()
```

or, for more detailed information, call `.reportQuery()` to return a `ModuleQuery` result containing the `BoundWitness`, `Payloads`, & any `Errors` (if present)

```swift
let result =  await panel.reportQuery()
let bw = result.bw
let payloads = result.payloads
let errors = result.errors
```
